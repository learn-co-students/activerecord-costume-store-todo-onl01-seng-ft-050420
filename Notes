#anytime you create a new migration file you need to run db:migrate
#looks in migrate folder and sees which ones are migrated
#if you don't have a schema file and you have files in your migration folder
#run the rollback command to undo something, then fix something, then run it again
# rake db:migrate means install all the migration files available
